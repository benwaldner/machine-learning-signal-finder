##Introduction:
Here we have a signal bot trading, using telegram (https://python-telegram-bot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/),
that finds signals with a predictor made with Machine Learning, trained with a some cryptho/usdt database, obtained
with the Binance library (https://resilient-quant-trader.medium.com/scraping-crypto-currency-historical-data-from-binance-using-python-9c0e77c04df7).


How to Install and Run the Project:
Install Binance library:
